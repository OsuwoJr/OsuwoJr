👋 Hi, I’m Osuwo Odongo John Frederick

Security-Focused Software Engineer | Frontend & Blockchain Developer | DevSecOps & Application Security Specialist
📍 Kenya 🇰🇪

I’m a Software Engineer specializing in Frontend Engineering, Blockchain Development, and Application Security (DevSecOps). I help teams build secure, scalable, and production-ready applications by combining strong UI engineering with secure-by-design principles across the entire software development lifecycle.

I have hands-on experience building decentralized applications (dApps), including meme coins, DAOs, NFT platforms, and blockchain dashboards using React, Svelte, Next.js, TypeScript, and blockchain platforms such as Hedera, Internet Computer (ICP), and Lisk.

Beyond building features, I focus on embedding security early — from secure code reviews and OWASP best practices to CI/CD pipeline hardening, dependency scanning, and log protection. I bridge the gap between engineering, security, and product, ensuring systems are not only functional and beautiful, but also resilient and safe.

I bring a product-oriented mindset, with experience in MVP design, UX flow optimization, and feature prioritization, helping reduce onboarding friction and align technical execution with business goals.
